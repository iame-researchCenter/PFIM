## Vignettes

The folder vignettes/ contains the two exemples that are given as vignettes on the CRAN.


## Examples

Several examples have been implemented in PFIM 6 and the full list and reports are given in **Examples_reports.md**. Source scripts are available in the folder Examples/, whose sub folders are organized as follows:

* Examples/
  * evaluation/
    * analytic/
    * analytic_infusion/
    * ode/
    * ode_infusion/
  * optimization/
  	* AlgoMutiplicatif/
    * FedorovWynn/ 
  	* PGBO/
  	* PSO/
  	* Simplex/

To execute all those scripts successively, one can run the script **run_Examples.R**. The reports will be created in the folder Outputs/Examples/.



## Evaluation tests

Several tests are available for design evaluation with PFIM; they are located in the folder tests_evaluation/, whose sub-folders are organized as follows:

* tests_evaluation/ : 
	* library_of_models/ : contains scripts that test the building of models with the library 
	* models_library_of_model/ : contains scripts that perform evaluation on models built with the library of models
	* models_user_defined/ : contains scripts that perform evaluation on models built manually by the user

To execute one scripts from models_library_of_model/ or  models_user_defined/, one has to define the variable `fimType` to either `population`, `individual` or `Bayesian`.

To execute all those scripts successively, one can run the script **run_tests_evaluation.R**. The outputs will be displayed in the folder Outputs/tests_evaluation/.

## Optimization tests

Several tests are available for design optimization with PFIM; they are located in the folder tests_optimization/, whose sub-folders are organized by algorithm.

* tests_optimization/ : 
	* FedorovWynn/ 
	* MultiplicativeAlgorithm/
	* PGBO/
	* PSO/
	* Simplex/
   
To execute all those scripts successively, one can run the script **run_tests_optimization.R**. The outputs will be displayed in the folder Outputs/tests_evaluation/.
