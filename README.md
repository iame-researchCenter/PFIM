## Vignettes

The folder vignettes/ contains the two exemples that are given as
vignettes on the CRAN.

## Examples

Several examples have been implemented in PFIM 6 and the full list and
reports are given in **Examples_reports.md**. Source scripts are
available in the folder Examples/, whose sub folders are organized as
follows:

- Examples/
  - evaluation/
    - analytic/
    - analytic_infusion/
    - ode/
    - ode_infusion/
  - optimization/
    - AlgoMutiplicatif/
    - FedorovWynn/
    - PGBO/
    - PSO/
    - Simplex/

To execute all those scripts successively, one can run the script
**run_Examples.R**. The reports will be created in the folder
Outputs/Examples/.

## Evaluation tests

Several tests are available for design evaluation with PFIM; they are
located in the folder tests_evaluation/, whose sub-folders are organized
as follows:

- tests_evaluation/ :
  - library_of_models/ : contains scripts that test the building of
    models with the library
  - models_library_of_model/ : contains scripts that perform evaluation
    on models built with the library of models
  - models_user_defined/ : contains scripts that perform evaluation on
    models built manually by the user

To execute one scripts from models_library_of_model/ or
models_user_defined/, one has to define the variable `fimType` to either
`population`, `individual` or `Bayesian`.

To execute all those scripts successively, one can run the script
**run_tests_evaluation.R**. The outputs will be displayed in the folder
Outputs/tests_evaluation/.

## Optimization tests

Several tests are available for design optimization with PFIM; they are
located in the folder tests_optimization/, whose sub-folders are
organized by algorithm.

- tests_optimization/ :
  - FedorovWynn/
  - MultiplicativeAlgorithm/
  - PGBO/
  - PSO/
  - Simplex/

To execute all those scripts successively, one can run the script
**run_tests_optimization.R**. The outputs will be displayed in the
folder Outputs/tests_evaluation/.
